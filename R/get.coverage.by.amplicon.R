    # NOTE: might be able to use bedr for actual bedtools commands, but it's currently not working
    #	
    # After each interval in A, bedtools coverage will report:
    #	- The number of features in B that overlapped (by at least one base pair) the A interval.
    #	- The number of bases in A that had non-zero coverage from features in B.
    #	- The length of the entry in A.
    #	- The fraction of bases in A that had non-zero coverage from features in B.
    #
    # These are the last four columns. Earlier columns will depend on the format of the panel BED file.
